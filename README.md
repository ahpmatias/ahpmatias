## About me
#### Hey there, Anderson here! I'm on a quest to get extremely proficient in all things data and software development, so here you can find anything from small projects to capstones, to learning repositories on several different topics.

#### Some of the stuff I've been doing:
- [100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp](https://github.com/ahpmatias/Python-100daysofcode-bootcamp)
- [Capstone Project: Predicting Boston House Prices](https://github.com/ahpmatias/capstone-boston-house-prices)
- [Space Race: An Exploratory Data Analysis (Work in Progress)](https://github.com/ahpmatias/space-race-analysis)
- [Web Development Training](https://github.com/ahpmatias/Web-Development-Training)
- [Capstone Project: IBM Data Science Certification Final Assignment](https://github.com/ahpmatias/IBM_Data_Science_Certificate_Capstone)
